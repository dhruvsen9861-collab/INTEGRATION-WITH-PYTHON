*DESCRIPTION*: Advanced Sales & Profit Dashboard Using Python in Power BI is a data-driven business intelligence project that highlights the integration of Python scripts within Power BI for advanced data analysis and visualization. The dashboard is built using cleaned and transformed sales data, where Python (specifically the pandas library) was used to filter records with Total Sales greater than ₹10,000 and perform custom calculations such as profit margins. Additionally, Python’s visualization libraries were applied to generate specialized graphs and insights that go beyond Power BI’s default visuals. This project demonstrates how combining Python with Power BI enhances data exploration, provides deeper business insights, and delivers a powerful, interactive analytics dashboard for decision-making.
